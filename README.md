# Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide minimalistic django project template that everyone can use, which _just works_ out of the box and has the basic setup you can expand on. 

# Vanilla

# Getting Started

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git clone git@github.com/bilaltahir2178/vanilla-todo.git
    $ cd vanilla-todo
    
Activate the virtualenv for your project.
    
Install project dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
Then simply apply the migrations:

    $ python manage.py migrate
    

You can now run the development server:

    $ python manage.py runserver
